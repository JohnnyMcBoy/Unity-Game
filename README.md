# Unity-Game
This is a test for making a twin stick shooter. I began this as a small side project as a way to learn Unity and C#, but as I progressed I have set my sights on something bigger than originally planned. Iâ€™m not sure how far I will get with the game, but I am picturing a rogue-like survival game, a mix between Stardew Valley and Enter the Gungeon. As of right now, it is nowhere near complete. It is just a simple twin stick shooter with no real goal besides survive the flying crystals. This is just a test environment I have been using while I play with different features. There are also some enemy types I am trying out off the playable area. My plan is to create a bunch of enemy types (AI and movement patterns) and get the character controls smoother before building the full playable environment.\
